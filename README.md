# React-Quiz

A quiz application built using Vite, React, Node.js, and the React Context API.

## Description

React-Quiz is a web application that allows users to take quizzes about React. The quiz questions are fetched from a local API spun up by `json-server` utilizing a .json file of q-a-pairs. This project demonstrates the use of Vite for development and build processes, React for the UI, and the React Context API for state management. It features progress bars, timers, scores, high scores, and minimal error handling.
